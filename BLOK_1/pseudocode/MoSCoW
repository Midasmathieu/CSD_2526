Must have:
simulation of a double pendulum in a for loop
user imput to where the double pendulum starts (in Ï€) and how long the pendulum swings (in seconds)
kick snare and hihat mapped to the ends of each pendulum
the option to quantize the rythm.
the option to save the rythm as a midi file.

should have:
a way to detect the periodicity of a non chaotic pendulum and loop the rythm accordingly
realtime pendulum with visualisation

Could have:
a way to navigate the non chaotic starting positions of the pendulum. (graph)
easter egg to let the pendulum swing until you manually stop it
velocity according to speed of the pendulums

wont have:
hardware pendulum with motors and stuff for theatrical effect
